# bitbots_jenkins_library

This is a small [*shared Jenkins library*](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) that is used by the Hamburg Bit-Bots to abstract pipeline configuration.

Its use is documented [here](http://doku.bit-bots.de/meta/manual/software/ci.html#enable-ci-for-a-repository).
